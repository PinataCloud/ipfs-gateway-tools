<a name="containsCID-anchor"></a>

### containsCID

##### `ipfsGatewayTools.containsCID(url)`

##### Params

- `url` - A gateway url that should take one of the following forms:
  - `ipfs://CID`
  - `ipfs://ipfs/CID`
  - `https://example-gateway.com/ipfs/CID`
  - `https://example-gateway.com/ipfs/CID/exampleFile.json`
  - `https://example-gateway.com/ipns/CID`
  - `https://CID.ipfs.example-gateway.com`
  - `https://CID.ipfs.example-gateway.com/exampleFile.json`

#### Response

```
{
    containsCid: (Boolean) - True if the url contains a CID,
    cid: (string) - The CID that the url contains if "containsCid" is true
}
```

<a name="convertToDesiredGateway-anchor"></a>

### convertToDesiredGateway

##### `ipfsGatewayTools.convertToDesiredGateway(sourceUrl, desiredGatewayPrefix)`

##### Params

- `sourceUrl` - A gateway url that should take one of the following forms:
  - `ipfs://CID`
  - `ipfs://ipfs/CID`
  - `https://example-gateway.com/ipfs/CID`
  - `https://example-gateway.com/ipfs/CID/exampleFile.json`
  - `https://example-gateway.com/ipns/CID`
  - `https://CID.ipfs.example-gateway.com`
  - `https://CID.ipfs.example-gateway.com/exampleFile.json`
- `desiredGatewayPrefix` - The desired gateway you want to convert your source URL to. A few examples of this would be:
  - `https://mygateway.mypinata.cloud`
  - `https://ipfs.io`

#### Response

Returns a string that uses the desired source gateway prefix.

Example code:

```javascript
const sourceUrl =
  "https://exampleGateway.com/ipfs/bafybeifx7yeb55armcsxwwitkymga5xf53dxiarykms3ygqic223w5sk3m";
const desiredGatewayPrefix = "https://mygateway.mypinata.cloud";
const convertedGatewayUrl = ipfsGatewayTools.convertToDesiredGateway(
  sourceUrl,
  desiredGatewayPrefix
);

//In the example above, the resulting value for convertedGatewayUrl would be: https://mygateway.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeifx7yeb55armcsxwwitkymga5xf53dxiarykms3ygqic223w5sk3m
```
